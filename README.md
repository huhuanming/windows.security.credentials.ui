@nodert-win11-22h2/windows.security.credentials.ui
=====

## Notice

The series of `@nodert-win11-22h2` packages is unofficially-published NodeRT modules for **Windows 11 SDK, version 22H2 (10.0.22621.0)** corresponding to Windows 11v22H2 (September 2022 Update).

These are generated by the modified version of NodeRT thus are experimental, as the original doesn't have support for 22H2 SDK, nor for building with VS2022. Supporting for VS2022 is based on <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT/pull/136" target="_blank">Taosenai's workaround with lxbndr's suggestion</a>. The modified source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/MaySoMusician/NodeRT/tree/feature/136-vs2019" target="_blank">here</a>.

Below is the original description about this module.

---

A Node.js wrapper for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/Windows.Security.Credentials.UI.aspx" target="_blank">Windows.Security.Credentials.UI</a> WinRT namespace, compatible with Windows 10 APIs.

Using this module, you'll be able to consume the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/Windows.Security.Credentials.UI.aspx" target="_blank">Windows.Security.Credentials.UI</a> API directly from Node.js.

This module was automatically generated by <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT" target="_blank">NodeRT</a>. 
For more information on NodeRT and examples on how to use NodeRT modules, please visit the project page at: <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT" target="_blank">https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT</a>.

The API exposed by this module is (almost) the same as the API that is listed in: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/Windows.Security.Credentials.UI.aspx" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/Windows.Security.Credentials.UI.aspx</a>

The only difference in the API is in the way that asynchronous methods and events are used. (See <a href="https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT#ConsumingNodeRT" target="_blank">https://github.com/NodeRT/NodeRT#ConsumingNodeRT</a> for more details)

This module also contains TypeScript definition files for the API exposed by the module, as well as JavaScript intellisense support for <a href="http://nodejstools.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Node.js tools for Visual Studio</a>.

Prequisites:
============
* Visual Studio 2022 and above. (Community edition works, other editions aren't tested but surely work!)

* <b>Important:</b> Updated versions of npm and node-gyp. (Note that the ones that are bundled with node might not be up to date). In order to install latest npm, run:
```
npm install -g npm
```

In order to install latest node-gyp run:
```
npm install -g node-gyp
```
